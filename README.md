# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup

This project is part of Capstone project at Algoritma Academy for Data Analytics Specialization. In this project, we will use the **BeautifulSoup** library from **bs4** to do web 
scraping. BeautifulSoup is a Python library that makes it easier for us to retrieve information from a web page that is in the form of HTML and XML documents. 

We are going to use data from the IMDb website, which is list of movies between 2019-01-01 and 2019-12-31 sorted by popularity. IMDb is an online database of information related 
to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online. Here we will only take seven most popular movies for our further analysis.
